# Pomegranate 
A segmentation and reconstruction pipeline that uses a combination of bright-field images, fluorescent markers, and the known morphological characteristics of fission yeast to produce a volumetric fit of a cellâ€™s whole cell and nuclear geometry.

## Version History
**Version 1.0** 
* Original internal release of Pomegranate

**Version 1.0b** 
* Added drop down menu for various hole filling algorithms (Shape-based, Regular, or None)
* Added an optional manual exclusion phase during whole-cell segmentation's filtering and smoothing

**Version 1.0c** 
* Replaced the equation for nuclear stability score to a simpler algorithm (cohesion radius).
  * The cohesion radius describes the smallest circle that can contain all centroids - centered at the mean position of the centroids. It can also be represented as the largest distance between the mean centroid and any single centroid.

**Version 1.0d** 
* Added 'segmentation only' option - removing the requirement for a channel with intensity images.

**Version 1.1** 
* Complete overhaul of reconstruction method. Reconstruction now compensates for nonuniform radii in cells.
